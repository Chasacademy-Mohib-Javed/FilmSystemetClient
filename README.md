The FilmSystemet project is built in C# and employs Minimal API, Entity Framework, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to manage a database effectively. It provides a comprehensive range of API endpoints enabling users to access detailed information about movies, genres, and users. Users can establish associations between movies or genres and users. Furthermore, the project integrates with TheMovieDB's API to support movie exploration based on genres and allows for the addition of new movies to the database seamlessly.
